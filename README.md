### How to Install and Run the Project:

For successful running this project you have to do the following steps:

	Step 1. Run the "Polinomial_Regression" Jupyter Notebook file on your PC/Notebook.

	Step 2. Import all reqired liabraries and dataframes from Section "Importing modules".

	Step 3. Import the dataset. Run the cell of the "Dataset" Section for getting previously mentioned project goals due to Polinomial Machine Learning model execution.

	Step 4. Run each cell with Python code within the Jupyter Notebook file sequentially following the instructions. Moreover, get familiar with a theoretical background and comprehensive interpretations of the employed Machine Learning Model to execute the goals of the underlying problem statement.
